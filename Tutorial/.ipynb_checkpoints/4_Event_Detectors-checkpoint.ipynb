    "Users can define their own EventDetectors but there are also several predefined EventDetectors\n",
    "already available, amongst which :\n",
    "\n",
    "- a simple DateDetector, which is simply triggered at a predefined date, and can be reset to add new dates on the run (which is useful to set up delays starting when a previous event is been detected)\n",
    "\n",
    "- an ElevationDetector, which is triggered at raising or setting time of a satellite with respect to a ground point, taking atmospheric refraction into account and either constant elevation or ground mask when threshold elevation is azimuth-dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "- an ElevationExtremumDetector, which is triggered at maximum (or minimum) satellite elevation with respect to a ground point\n",
    "\n",
    "- an AltitudeDetector which is triggered when satellite crosses a predefined altitude limit and can be used to compute easily operational forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "- a FieldOfViewDetector which is triggered when some target enters or exits a satellite sensor Field Of View (any shape),\n",
    "- a CircularFieldOfViewDetector which is triggered when some target enters or exits a satellite sensor Field Of View (circular shape),\n",
    "- a FootprintOverlapDetector which is triggered when a sensor Field Of View (any shape, even split in non-connected parts or containing holes) overlaps a geographic zone, which can be non-convex, split in different sub-zones, have holes, contain the pole,\n",
    "- a GeographicZoneDetector, which is triggered when the spacecraft enters or leave a zone, which can be non-convex, split in different sub-zones, have holes, contain the pole,\n",
    "- a GroundFieldOfViewDetector, which is triggered when the spacecraft enters or leave a ground based Field Of View, which can be non-convex, split in different sub-zones, have holes,\n",
    "- an EclipseDetector, which is triggered when some body enters or exits the umbra or the penumbra of another occulting body,\n",
    "- an ApsideDetector, which is triggered at apogee and perigee,\n",
    "- a NodeDetector, which is triggered at ascending and descending nodes,\n",
    "- a PositionAngleDetector, which is triggered when satellite angle on orbit crosses some value (works with either anomaly, latitude argument or longitude argument and with either true, eccentric or mean angles),\n",
    "- LatitudeCrossingDetector, LatitudeExtremumDetector, LongitudeCrossingDetector, LongitudeExtremumDetector, which are triggered when satellite position with respect to central body reaches some predefined values,\n",
    "- an AlignmentDetector, which is triggered when satellite and some body projected in the orbital plane have a specified angular separation (the term AlignmentDetector is clearly a misnomer as the angular separation may be non-zero),\n",
    "- an AngularSeparationDetector, which is triggered when angular separation between satellite and some beacon as seen by an observer goes below a threshold. The beacon is typically the Sun, the observer is typically a ground station\n",
    "- An EventShifter is also provided in order to slightly shift the events occurrences times. A typical use case is for handling operational delays before or after some physical event really occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EventSlopeFilter is provided when user is only interested in one kind of events that occurs in pairs like raising in the raising/setting pair for elevation detector, or eclipse entry in the entry/exit pair for eclipse detector. The filter does not simply ignore events after they have been detected, it filters them before they are located and hence save some computation time by not doing an accurate search for events that will ultimately be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EventEnablingPredicateFilter is provided when user wants to filter out some events based on an external condition set up by a user-provided enabling predicate function. This allow for example to dynamically turn some events on and off during propagation or to set up some elaborate logic like triggering on elevation first time derivative (i.e. one elevation maximum) but only when elevation itself is above some threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "A BooleanDetector is provided to combine several other detectors with boolean operators and, or and not. This allows for example to detect when a satellite is both visible from a ground station and out of eclipse."
